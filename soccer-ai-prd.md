# Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Develop an immersive browser-based 5v5 soccer game using Three.js with gameplay mechanics inspired by FIFA. Initially designed as a single-player experience against AI, with future potential to incorporate online multiplayer features.

## Target Audience
- Casual gamers
- Fans of soccer and FIFA-style games
- Users seeking accessible, engaging browser-based entertainment

## Key Features

### 1. Gameplay Mechanics
- **Match Format:** 5 vs. 5
- **Match Duration:** Short matches (~3-5 minutes)
- **Objective:** Score more goals than the opponent within the allotted time
- **Player Controls:** Keyboard-based controls
  - **Movement:** Players move directly according to the pressed keys (WASD or arrow keys), irrespective of the facing direction
  - **Pass:** Spacebar for automatically accurate passes to the best-positioned teammate
  - **Shoot:** X key to attempt a shot on goal
  - **Sprint:** Shift key for a temporary speed boost, limited by stamina

### 2. Player Switching and Ball Control
- Automatically switch control to the player closest to the ball
- Automatically switch control to the player possessing the ball
- Manual override available for player switching
- Players can dribble and precisely control the ball while moving

### 3. Camera System
- FIFA-inspired broadcast-style camera angle
- Smooth, dynamic tracking of ball and active player
- Camera and player positions reset after each goal

### 4. Visual Design
- Entirely procedural generation of all game assets using basic 3D shapes in Three.js (no external image or model assets)
- Simplified low-poly 3D visuals optimized for browser performance
- Clearly distinguishable player uniforms and field markings

### 5. AI Bots
- Difficulty Levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Defined roles: Defender, midfielder, attacker
- Intelligent AI decision-making (passing, shooting, positioning, defending)
- Pathfinding and realistic player movements

### 6. User Interface
- Main menu: Mode selection, difficulty settings, basic customization
- In-game HUD: Scoreboard, game timer, player stamina indicator
- Pause menu: Resume, restart, quit options

### 7. Audio Effects
- Realistic in-game sounds (ball kicks, crowd cheers, referee whistles)

## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Three.js
- Backend (Future): Node.js, WebSockets for multiplayer support

### Browser Compatibility
